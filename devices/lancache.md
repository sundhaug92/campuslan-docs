This is an HP Proliant something-or-another with a Xeon something-or-another (Westmere-EP) with a ton of cores and RAM. Its onboard-disks are four disks configured in RAID 5, to ensure it "just works". In addition to its onboard disks, this thing is directly connected to a NetApp box (so no controller, using XX gbps fiber) with 10 200 GB SSDs in RAID0 (referenced in lancache-scripts as yolo-mode). Theoretically, this thing should be able to push out about 5 gbps+ of data (based on the total speed of the SSDs).
