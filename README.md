This repository documents CampusLAN infrastructure, including our [devices](./devices/)

This repository is "hosted" by [**@sundhaug92**](https://github.com/sundhaug92) while we await a CampusLAN/datagruppa org and is private while its content is reviewed.

This repository is meant to help the public have insight in how we do things, and to make documents easily accessible for newcomers.
